Overview
========

Python library to interface with a WordPress blog's `XML-RPC API`__.

__ http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support

An implementation of the standard WordPress API methods is provided,
but the library is designed for easy integration with custom
XML-RPC API methods provided by plugins.

This library was developed against and tested on WordPress 3.5.
This library is compatible with Python 2.6+ and 3.2+.

This branch of python-wordpress-xmlrpc is tested on trunk of
WordPress 3.4 with the wp-xmlrpc-modernization plugin installed.
